# Smart-brain-tumor-classification-and-segmentation-(vita)

## About
This web application aims to help doctors and medical students classify brain MRI images into four categories: 
- Butterfly Glioblastoma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary Tumors
- No Tumors

Additionally, the application provides a segmentation tool to help doctors segment the dimensions of the tumors before performing surgical operations.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Classify brain MRI images into four categories using a machine learning model.
- **Tumor Segmentation Tool**: A tool to segment the tumors' dimensions for pre-surgical analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap** to ensure an intuitive and responsive user experience.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The application uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based on the **VGG16** architecture for image classification and analysis.
  
## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the web application and making it responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic client-side interactions and features.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework used to handle backend processes.
- **Bootstrap**: For a responsive and mobile-friendly layout.
- **Machine Learning**:
    - **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: Used for image classification.
    - **VGG16**: A pre-trained model used for the classification of brain MRI images.
